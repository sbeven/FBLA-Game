# BAA: The Game
## A Leader's Walk 

"A Leader's Walk" is a game that educates FBLA members and non-FBLA members about the FBLA Business Achievement Awards (BAA) Program through an applicable simulation. The user will first enter the main menu with the option to change the volume, read the instructions, view the scoreboard (multiplayer), or even change the game's difficulty to hard (advanced feature). When the user finally makes their desired adjustments, they can enter the game that progressively gets harder through 4 different settings: chapter,regional,state,and national. The user gets to experience what is is like for a leader to rise up the ranks in FBLA by following the BAA guidlelines of service, education, and progress. The activities of collecting money,taking a quiz,and recruiting new members mimick real-life activities that leaders have to follow in order to be successful. We took a creative approach of implementing a double-jump feature and enemy AI (frogs and eagles) in order for the user to have the most enjoyable experience as they play. The overall goal is for the user to avoid the bad ending where the player runs out of lives and to get the good ending where the player collects their medals at the national competition - thus the leader's walk will have concluded.
